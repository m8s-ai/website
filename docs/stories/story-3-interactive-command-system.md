# Interactive Terminal Command System - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user in the terminal overlay**,  
I want **to type commands to explore M8S portfolio, services, and capabilities interactively**,  
So that **I can discover information at my own pace using familiar terminal commands**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Enhanced Terminal component (from Stories 1-2) after greeting completion
- Technology: Command parser, state management with existing useState patterns, analytics integration
- Follows pattern: Existing Terminal text rendering, audio feedback, analytics event tracking
- Touch points: Terminal text display system, audio system, analyticsManager, existing conversation flow

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Command Processing:** Implement command parser after greeting completes - user can type `help`, `portfolio`, `services`, `contact`, `pricing`
2. **Portfolio Display:** `portfolio` command shows formatted project history with filtering options (`portfolio web`, `portfolio mobile`)
3. **Service Information:** `services` and `pricing` commands display formatted service offerings and pricing tiers from existing TerminalWebsite data

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Commands appear after existing greeting sequence without affecting boot timing or conversation flow option
5. Command output follows existing Terminal text rendering patterns and font styling
6. Analytics integration captures command usage via existing analyticsManager patterns (`trackTerminalEvent`)

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Command history with up/down arrow navigation (store last 10 commands)
8. Tab completion for available commands with visual feedback
9. Easter egg commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `clear`) for authentic terminal feel

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add command mode state after existing greeting completion, use existing Terminal text display and input handling
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current Terminal state management with useState hooks, preserve audio feedback patterns, maintain analytics event structure
- **Key Constraints:** Must not interfere with existing conversation flow option, command mode is additive after greeting completes

## Definition of Done

- [x] Interactive command system functional after Terminal greeting with help documentation
- [x] Portfolio, services, contact, pricing commands display properly formatted information
- [x] Command history and tab completion working with up/down arrows and tab key
- [x] Easter egg commands (`ls`, `pwd`, `whoami`, `clear`) implemented for developer appeal
- [x] Analytics tracking captures command usage patterns via existing analyticsManager
- [x] Existing Terminal-to-conversation flow preserved as option alongside command exploration

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Command system interfering with existing Terminal conversation flow or boot sequence
- **Mitigation:** Command mode only activates after greeting completion, conversation option remains available
- **Rollback:** Disable command processing with feature flag, preserve greeting-to-conversation flow only

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing Terminal boot sequence or greeting display
- [x] Conversation flow option remains available alongside command exploration
- [x] Command text rendering follows existing Terminal font and styling patterns  
- [x] Analytics integration uses established analyticsManager.trackTerminalEvent patterns

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (6-8 hours)
- [x] Integration approach builds on existing Terminal text display and input systems
- [x] Follows existing Terminal component patterns (state management, audio, analytics)
- [x] Command data sources from existing TerminalWebsite component information

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements specify exact commands and expected output formats
- [x] Integration points clearly defined (Terminal display, analytics, audio system)
- [x] Success criteria include preservation of existing conversation functionality
- [x] Rollback approach maintains existing Terminal behavior
