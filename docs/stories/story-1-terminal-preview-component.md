# Terminal Preview Component Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **website visitor**,  
I want **to see a compact terminal preview on the homepage that I can click to explore**,  
So that **I can get a preview of the technical experience without being forced into it immediately**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: HomePage component and existing section layout 
- Technology: React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui patterns
- Follows pattern: Component composition like existing HeroSection, ServicesSection
- Touch points: HomePage main layout, audio system (useAudioManager), scale animations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Terminal Preview Display:** Create TerminalPreview component that shows compact terminal window with blinking cursor and minimal boot text
2. **Homepage Integration:** Add TerminalPreview to HomePage layout without disrupting existing sections (after HeroSection, before ServicesSection)
3. **Click Interaction:** Terminal preview responds to click with scale animation transition and expanding sound effect

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing HomePage sections (Hero, Services, Outcomes, etc.) continue to render unchanged
5. New TerminalPreview follows existing HomePage component composition pattern 
6. Integration with audio system (useAudioManager) maintains current sound effect patterns

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Component is fully responsive and maintains HomePage mobile compatibility
8. Animation performance is smooth (60fps) across browsers
9. No regression in existing HomePage functionality verified through testing

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add TerminalPreview as self-contained component in HomePage between existing sections
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow HeroSection component structure - TypeScript interface, useLanguage context, Tailwind styling
- **Key Constraints:** Must not affect existing page layout flow, animations must be performant on mobile devices

## Definition of Done

- [x] TerminalPreview component displays compact terminal window with authentic appearance
- [x] Click interaction triggers smooth scale animation with expanding audio feedback  
- [x] Integration with HomePage maintains existing section layout and functionality
- [x] Component follows existing TypeScript and styling patterns
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [x] No performance regression in HomePage loading or scrolling

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** TerminalPreview component disrupting HomePage layout or performance
- **Mitigation:** Component designed as self-contained with CSS isolation, performance tested
- **Rollback:** Hide component with simple CSS display:none or feature flag

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing HomePage components or routing
- [x] CSS changes are additive only (new classes, no modifications to existing)
- [x] Animation follows existing CSS animation patterns in codebase  
- [x] Audio integration follows established useAudioManager patterns

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (4-6 hours)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (component composition)
- [x] Follows existing HomePage component patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

**Clarity Check:**
- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous and testable
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified (HomePage, audio system)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- [x] Rollback approach is simple (hide component)
