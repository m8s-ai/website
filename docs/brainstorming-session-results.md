**Visual Sequence:**
```
[Screen powers on with vacuum tube warmup hum]
INITIALIZING NEURAL NETWORKS... ✓
LOADING REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS ENGINE... ✓  
CALIBRATING CONVERSATION PROTOCOLS... ✓
PROJECT VALIDATION MATRIX ONLINE... ✓
READY FOR DEEP ANALYSIS...
[Blinking block cursor appears]
```

> [OPTION A] Mobile app for restaurants     ◄── SELECTED
  [OPTION B] Web platform for freelancers
  [OPTION C] Desktop software for accounting  
  [OPTION D] Other (type your answer)
```

**RPG-Style Interaction:**
- Retro quest game navigation feel
- Enter to select, Escape to go back
- Visual highlight with `> [SELECTED] <` brackets

### **VISUAL DESIGN SYSTEM**

**Color Scheme:** Amber/Green mix (Pip-Boy inspired)
- **Primary Text:** Bright amber-green hybrid
- **Background:** Deep black 
- **Accents:** Brighter green for highlights
- **Screen Effect:** Subtle green glow around entire viewport edges

**Typography & Animation:**
- **Text Appearance:** Fast typewriter effect (skilled operator speed)
- **Font:** Monospace terminal font
- **Cursor:** Classic blinking block cursor (█)
- **Layout:** Full-screen terminal, content centered
- **Browser Chrome:** Hidden - complete immersion

**Visual Effects:**
- **Screen Glow:** Subtle ambient glow around screen edges
- **Text Animation:** Character-by-character typewriter with mechanical sounds
- **Cursor:** 500ms blink rate for classic terminal feel

### **AUDIO DESIGN SYSTEM**

**Interaction Sounds:**
- **Arrow Navigation:** Subtle electronic beeps (up/down different pitches)
- **Selection:** Confirmation tone
- **Typing:** Mechanical keyboard clicks for each keystroke
- **Enter Key:** Satisfying mechanical "thunk" sound
- **Backspace:** Softer mechanical click

**Ambient Audio:**
- **Background:** Subtle electronic hum throughout session
- **Boot Sequence:** Vacuum tube warmup building to operational hum
- **System Messages:** Electronic whirs and beeps

### **MOBILE OPTIMIZATION**

**Layout Adaptations:**
- **Full-Screen:** Maintained on mobile with optimized typography
- **Touch Targets:** Larger touch areas for option selection
- **Font Sizing:** Increased for mobile readability while preserving aesthetic
- **Keyboard Integration:** Smooth virtual keyboard appearance for text input

**Interaction Methods:**
- **Touch Selection:** Direct tap on options (alternative to arrow navigation)
- **Gesture Support:** Potential swipe gestures for option selection
- **Portrait Optimization:** Designed primarily for portrait orientation
