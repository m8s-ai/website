# Firebase Analytics Setup Guide for m8s

## Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Project name: "m8s-analytics"
4. Enable Google Analytics when prompted
5. Choose your Google Analytics account or create new one
6. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Add Web App
1. In Firebase console, click the web icon "</>"
2. App nickname: "m8s-website"
3. Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" (optional)
4. Click "Register app"
5. Copy the configuration object that appears

### Step 3: Update Firebase Config
1. Open `src/utils/firebase.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder config with your real config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef123456",
  measurementId: "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
};
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation
1. Run `npm start` in your terminal
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8080
3. Open browser console (F12 â†’ Console tab)
4. Look for messages starting with "ðŸ”¥ Analytics:"
5. Go through the user flow: landing â†’ terminal â†’ Aria conversation

### Step 5: Verify Data in Firebase
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Analytics â†’ Events
2. Click on "DebugView" in the left sidebar
3. You should see events appearing in real-time
4. Main events to look for:
   - session_start
   - app_initialized
   - terminal_entered
   - terminal_boot_started

## Viewing Your Analytics Data

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Firebase Console â†’ Analytics â†’ Realtime**
- Shows active users and current events
- Updates every few seconds
- Great for testing new features

### Event Analysis
- **Firebase Console â†’ Analytics â†’ Events**
- All custom events we've implemented
- Click any event to see parameters
- Filter by date ranges

### Debug View (Development)
- **Firebase Console â†’ Analytics â†’ DebugView**
- Real-time event stream
- Only shows events from debug-enabled devices
- Perfect for testing new tracking

### Conversion Events
Set up these events as conversions:
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Analytics â†’ Events
2. Find these events and click "Mark as conversion":
   - aria_conversation_completed
   - terminal_conversation_initiated
   - navigation_cta_clicked

## Key Reports to Create

### User Journey Funnel
Create a custom funnel to track:
1. session_start â†’ terminal_entered
2. terminal_entered â†’ terminal_conversation_initiated  
3. terminal_conversation_initiated â†’ aria_conversation_started
4. aria_conversation_started â†’ aria_conversation_completed

### Lead Quality Dashboard
Monitor these metrics:
- Average lead_score from aria_conversation_completed events
- Conversion rate by conversation_path (start_project vs learn_more)
- Response quality (answer_length, answer_words)
- Time to conversion (total_duration)

### Abandonment Analysis
Track drop-off points:
- terminal_boot_started vs terminal_boot_completed
- aria_question_presented vs aria_question_answered
- Most common abandonment_point values
- Correlation between audio_enabled and completion rates

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Appearing
1. Check browser console for Firebase errors
2. Verify Firebase config is correct
3. Make sure you're not using an ad blocker
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Events Missing Parameters
1. Check console for parameter truncation warnings
2. Firebase limits: parameter names â‰¤40 chars, values â‰¤100 chars
3. Our analytics manager handles this automatically

### Real-time vs Reporting Delay
- DebugView: Instant
- Realtime reports: 1-2 minutes
- Standard reports: 24-48 hours
- Export to BigQuery: Near real-time

## Advanced Configuration

### Export to BigQuery (Recommended)
1. Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings
2. Click "Integrations" tab
3. Find BigQuery and click "Link"
4. Enable for Analytics data
5. This allows custom SQL queries and advanced analysis

### Custom Audiences
Create user segments based on behavior:
- Users who completed conversations
- Users who abandoned at specific points
- High-value leads (lead_score > 15)
- Return visitors vs new visitors

### A/B Testing Setup
1. Firebase Console â†’ Remote Config
2. Create parameters for:
   - Boot sequence timing
   - Question ordering
   - Audio default state
   - Conversation flow variations

## Privacy & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- Firebase Analytics uses anonymized data
- No cookie consent required for basic analytics
- User IDs are generated, not personal
- Data retention: 14 months (configurable)

### Data Processing
- All events are processed client-side
- No sensitive data (passwords, emails) tracked
- User responses truncated to 100 characters
- Location data limited to country/region

## Business Intelligence Integration

### Export Options
- **Firebase Console**: Basic reports and dashboards
- **Google Analytics**: Advanced web analytics features
- **BigQuery**: SQL queries and custom analysis
- **Data Studio**: Visual dashboards and reports
- **API Access**: Custom integrations and real-time monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Conversion Rate**: terminal_entered â†’ aria_conversation_completed
- **Lead Quality**: Average lead_score trends
- **User Experience**: Session duration and abandonment points
- **Feature Usage**: Audio toggle rates, conversation paths chosen
- **Technical Performance**: Response times and error rates

## Getting Help

### Resources
- **Firebase Documentation**: https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics
- **Analytics Events Reference**: See our analytics-events.md document
- **Console Help**: Click "?" in Firebase Console for contextual help

### Common Issues
- **Slow event reporting**: Normal for first 24-48 hours
- **Missing events**: Check console for JavaScript errors
- **Parameter limits**: Our system auto-truncates long values
- **Cross-domain tracking**: Not needed for single-page app

Your analytics system is now fully implemented and ready to provide insights into user behavior, conversion optimization opportunities, and business intelligence for the m8s platform!
